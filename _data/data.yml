    title: The Most Wonderfullest SCP Within The Foundation
    info: "The Tickle Monster"
      - role: <b>Item </b> SCP-999
        time:
        company: <b>Object Class</b> Adorable
        details: |
          <b>Special Containment Procedures</b>: This cutie-patootie can wonder around the facility as much as they like, except when taking a li l nap or during an emergency to keep them safe.
          The cutie pie needs to stay in its pen at night and cannot be taken outside for walkies.
          The adorable one s pen needs to be kept clean and food replenished twice a day (they like candy, so cute!).
          Everyone is welcome to visit this bundle of love, but only when not busy with something else.
          Please play with the peanut butter blob when they are bored and be polite and gentle when talking to them.
          
          <b>Description</b>: The Tickle Monster is a large blob of orange slime with a consistency similar to peanut butter, weighing about 52kg (120lbs).
          This lovely glop can change size and shape at will, normally looking like a round pile of thick liquid about 2 meters (6 feet) wide and 1 meter (3 feet) tall.
          The BestBoy is very stretchy and doesn t absorb liquids unless intentional and can digest food and drink easily.
          
          <p>The Tickle Monster behaves like a cute little puppy, giving visitors hugs with its little nubblies, purring, and giving off the person  s favorite scent.
          
          <p>Touching this absolute unit causes a person to feel good all over, the longer the better and lasting a while afterwards!
          This adorable guy s favorite activity is “tickle-wrestling”, wrapping a person s body with their goo and tickling them all over.
          Though they never intentionally hurt someone while “tickle-wrestling”, they immediately apologize if they do.
          
          <p>This little hero will interact with anyone but will gravitate towards people who are hurt or unhappy in any way.
          
          <p>SCP-999 loves all animals, especially humans, to the point which they are vegan, and will even risk its own life to save others (so noble!).
          This ray of sunshine only eats candy and sweets, eating by absorbing items.
          Their favorites are M&M s and Necco Wafers!
